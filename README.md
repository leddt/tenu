# Tenu CMS

## Overview

Tenu is a work-in-progress dotnet core CMS, with the following goals:

- Being easy to use for developpers
  - Configuration of content types saved in json files that are checked-in with the project
  - Simple installation into any aspnet core app
- Supporting flexible use cases
  - Use it as a traditional website manager, or as a headless CMS with a REST or GraphQL API
  - Enable only the features you need
  - Allow for easy extensibility
- Using a tree structure to organize content
  - Inspired by Umbraco
  - Easy to understand for non-technical users
  - URLs derived from the content structure

## Current state

This is still a very early prototype. It's absolutely not yet ready for anything at all. There is no documentation, and features are mostly unfinished / absent.

## Name

Tenu comes from _contenu_, the french word for _content_. It's short, sounds good and appears to be relatively unused.
